## Description

Windows Automated General Servitor (WAGS) is a python-powered application that
aids in use of the Windows operating system. It aims to simplify the use of
a Windows computer by offering essential system features. These features can be accessed by running the built-in voice assistant. The assistant must first be started through the green play button located on the bottom of the application, then you can ask the assistant to perform a command by saying:
<p align="center">"Hey WAGS [command]"</p>
WAGS will not respond to a command unless you say his name first.
